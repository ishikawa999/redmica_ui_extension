# RedMica UI extension

This plugin adds useful UI improvements that are difficult to implement in Redmine itself.

## Features

* 1. Makes the Redmine select box searchable.
* 2. Add Burndown chart on version detail.
* 3. Prevent submit by accidentally pressing `Enter key` in the subject field of the issue form. Instead, you can quickly save the subject with `Control + Enter`, `Command + Return`.

WIP: More detailed feature introduction.
